----- readme.os2

I compiled xbin with Microsoft C 6.0 and bound it to work with
OS/2 protected mode and MS-DOS. I also run EXEHDR /NEWFILES, so
xbin should understand long filenames in OS/2 1.2 HPFS-filesystem.

No modifications was made to souces. I only modified MAKEFILE.MS
to work correctly with OS/2.
